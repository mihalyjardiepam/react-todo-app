# Over-engineered React TODO App
This project is for me to learn about some technologies that I have not used before.

## Planned Structure:
### 1.0
- Client-side TODO app, save data into `localStorage`, 1 user
- TODO items should have 3 states: `Not Started`, `In progress`, `Done`
- Use TS where possible
